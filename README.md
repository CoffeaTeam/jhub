[![Release Status](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/jhub/workflows/Release%20Charts/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/jhub/actions)

This functionality is in beta and is subject to change.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is needed to be installed to use the `coffea-casa-jhub` charts.
(please check Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started).

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```sh
helm repo add coffea-casa-jhub https://coffeateam.github.io/jhub
```

You can then run `helm search repo coffea-casa-jhub` to see the charts.
